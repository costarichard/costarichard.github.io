My name is Richard and I just started my PhD in Physics at [Federal University of ABC](http://ri.ufabc.edu.br/en/) at the [Quantum Information group](https://www.quantumufabc.org/). I started this blog to procrastinate in a [useful manner](structuredprocrastination.com).

I've also worked as a freelance writer and Portuguese translator in the past. If you think you have a job for me, don't hesitate reach out <mailto:scosta.richard@gmail.com>!
