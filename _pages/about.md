My name is Richard and I just started my PhD in Physics at [Federal University of ABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/en/) at the [Quantum Information Group](https://www.quantumufabc.org/). This blog is my [structured procrastination](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com).

I've also worked as a freelance writer and Portuguese translator in the past. If you think you have a job for me, don't hesitate to reach out: <mailto:scosta.richard@gmail.com>!
