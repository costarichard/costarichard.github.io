My name is Richard and I just started my PhD in Physics at the [Federal University of ABC](http://ri.ufabc.edu.br/en/) at the [Quantum Information group](https://www.quantumufabc.org/). I started this blog to have my learning documented and as a way to procrastinate in a [useful manner](structuredprocrastination.com). I also intend to make my notes on math & physics publics, at the page "Notes" in this website.

I've also worked as a freelance writer and Portuguese translator in the past, creating content on topics as different as casino games and machine learning for business. If you think you have a job for me, don't hesitate to contact me at <mailto:scosta.richard@gmail.com>!
