## Summary


*This is the third post in a series of posts on using Roam for research. This post is about using a page to gather all blocks that work as tags or categories.*

<p><span style="float: left; width: 0.8em; font-size: 600%; font-family: Georgia, courier; line-height: 75%;">I</span>n previous posts I talked about using blocks to declutter the amount of pages in your graph (database) and a specific use of them as bibliographical entries in a reference page. You can read those posts <a href="https://costarichard.github.io/tools/roam/roam-blocks/">here</a>, and <a href= "https://costarichard.github.io/tools/roam/roam-blocksII-citations/">here</a>.This post is just an extension of those two. After you figured some pages that are just used for categories are better off as blocks, you can put together all those blocks into one page so it's easy for you to keep track of them. This is not necessary, but it can be helpful to some. Here's a snapshot of mine</p>

If the numbers showing the block mentions seem too dim you can use another roam theme

*To use this roam theme go to https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY and watch the video on how to use roam themes. This one is called Dark Age.*

Of course, how is the page structured is highly dependent on your needs. I could, for example, put the TODOs related blocks in the TODO roam page. It doesn't matter that much as long as you can find all the relevant blocks later.

You can also use block versions to group tags that are of the same 'kind'. For example, it's common people like to tag notes whether they are books, articles, podcasts, etc. That is, categorizing based on different kind of medias you're taking the notes from. We can use an unique block to do that. First create a block for tagging book notes, something like BookNotes. Then right-click on the block and select 'add version', or just use the shortcut `ctrl + comma`. The block will show up like this:

If you click the number 2, it will open up a version tab and you can add a third version by clicking the plus sign or hitting `ctrl + comma` again. Write down as you would in a common block. Clicking the number will hide/show the versions of that block.

Here's an example of how it would look like referencing those blocks and their versions:

You can see that by clicking the block reference, the block mention is shown exactly to what version of that block you referenced. If you reference `BooksNotes` more than those other versions, you can still keep track of that. Compare:
