## Summary


*This is the third post in a series of posts on using Roam for research. This one is about using a page to gather all blocks that work as tags or categories.*

<p><span style="float: left; width: 0.8em; font-size: 600%; font-family: Georgia, courier; line-height: 75%;">I</span>n previous posts I talked about using blocks to declutter the amount of pages in your graph (database) and a specific use of them as bibliographical entries in a reference page. You can read those posts <a href="https://costarichard.github.io/tools/roam/roam-blocks/">here</a>, and <a href= "https://costarichard.github.io/tools/roam/roam-blocksII-citations/">here</a>.This post is just an extension of those two. After you figured some pages that are just used for categories are better off as blocks, you can put together all those blocks into one page so it's easy for you to keep track of them. This is not necessary, but it can be helpful to some people. Here's a snapshot of mine</p>

If the numbers showing the block mentions seem too dim you can use another roam theme

*To use this roam theme go to https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY and watch the video on how to use roam themes. This one is called Dark Age.*

Of course, how is the page structured is highly dependent on your needs. I could, for example, put the blocks related to TODOs in the default TODO page. It doesn't matter that much as long as you can find all the relevant blocks later.

##Versions

You can also use block versions to group tags that are of the same 'kind'. For example, it's common for people to tag notes based on the kind of media they're taking the notes from: books, articles, podcasts, etc. We can group all those different kinds of media in a single block with different versions. First, create a block for tagging book notes, something like `BookNotes`. Then right-click on the block and select 'add version', or just use the shortcut `ctrl + comma`. The block will now look like this:

If you click the number 2, it will open up a version tab and you can add a third version by clicking the plus sign or hitting `ctrl + comma` again. Write down as you would in a common block. Clicking the number will hide/show the versions of that block:

By clicking the block reference we can see that the block mention is unique for each version: if you reference one more than the other you will still be able to keep track of that.

As for the referencing itself, here's an example of how it would look like referencing those blocks and their versions:

That's it for now. The main takeaway for me is that we can clutter up really quickly our roam graph if we use tags indiscriminately. If that doesn't bother you, or if you can keep a better workflow that way, great! But for me, it was becoming too distracting. The blocks page I showed here has 13 blocks that used to be pages. When I first started taking notes on Roam, that number used to be quite higher, maybe around 40. I still think that linking pages should be reserved for meaningful connections and tags were not adding meaning to the content in my notes. Later, I found out that this approach is somewhat similar to that of the so-called _zettelkasten_ approach, described in Sönke Ahren's book "[How to Take Smart Notes](https://geni.us/NVmm4v)". But that's a conversation for another time.
