## Summary

*This is the second post on using Roam for learning languages. For part I click [here](https://costarichard.github.io/tools/roam/deltas-roam/)*.

In this post we're gonna see how to practice speaking, listening and usage & grammar in Roam.  Let's start with listening and speaking.

## Listening and Speaking

What you can do here (and this is just an idea) is upload audio from text to speech services to Roam so we can check our pronunciation. We download the audio file from those websites, upload them to roam and use the delta to schedule them for the future.

To download those audio files you can go, for example, to <https://soundoftext.com/>. There you can type your sentence and download the audio file which is the google translate voice output. Then you upload it to Roam by using `/upload`.

If you want to have more options than just the google translate output you can use other services like nextup.com or <https://acapela-group.com>. After writing down and playing the audio, you right-click the play button, and select 'inspect'. A window is gonna open up, you go to 'network' on the top right corner and play the audio again. You'll be able to spot a 'media' type file, and doubling-clicking it will open a new tab and you can download the audio from there. I've made a loom video showing you this process:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/9870ee5b6005424fa991b5c9eb2e57f8" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

$~$

After you have your audio ready and uploaded to Roam, you nest them under the sentence you're practicing, like this

So far we already have translation and an audio file. I put an ear emoji just for decoration, but it's kind of useful to know immediately that this block is about listening. Using the delta feature the block will show up in your daily notes like this

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMinHjerne%2Fc6p_LxmGlb.png?alt=media&token=b3e57311-aaaa-4c22-90a4-516cb39e7785)

We can then play the audio, write what we heard underneath the block, check our answer with the block reference and hit the delta if we get it right:

And for speaking the process is similar, but this time we send the block for speaking

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMinHjerne%2FUERsF7WcAg.png?alt=media&token=75333932-96bd-491a-8c28-f57c5cd4d332)

Where I uploaded 3 different audio samples so as to compare pronunciations.

We can speak, check our pronunciation with the block reference again, and hit the delta if we get it right

To conclude this section, it is useful to use templates to replace the emojis I used to denote 'speaking' and 'listening' blocks

## Usage

One way to test usage of language is to create dropdown menus by using the syntax `{{or: | option A | option B | option C}}`. That way we mimic fill-in-the-blank type of exercises. See for example:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMinHjerne%2FolJQtbR_ZS.gif?alt=media&token=fa63c727-a961-4fa4-add3-f435f610018d)

where I used the underline `_` so as to make it more visible. In the context of our sentence, the options are wrong answers and the correct one

In the daily notes it will look like this

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMinHjerne%2F7THfsFYGIQ.gif?alt=media&token=0ffe8cb0-72c5-462d-add1-c85855384377)

We could even use this to create little quizzes

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMinHjerne%2FV6zgwGdvgP.png?alt=media&token=d1654614-5afb-41dc-9263-b6bcace720b3)

With the syntax

By the way, this works with $LaTeX$ too, and it looks quite nice:

## Final Remarks & Takeaways

So with just one sentence we could see how to practice four aspects of the language, all organized by nesting under the sentence block. This is how the end result looks

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMinHjerne%2Fk-y2YL3F4W.png?alt=media&token=a4f982bb-7e7c-4841-94bc-b526003a570a)

where I included some grammar notes at the end. So the main takeaway here is that _each_ block can be sent to future days so you can practice different aspects of the language as you want. Of course, this is just one way of organizing things. I thought it was neat because it can show you the power of using blocks to store a lot of related information for different purposes. And because Roam can deal with audio, video, drawings, equations, pdfs, etc., you can make your learning experience quite rich and use Roam as your suite for knowledge.
